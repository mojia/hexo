<font face="Menlo" size=4>There is only one true Gospel, only be center of Jesus, only be center of Cross. Like apostle Paul said : 

***For I decided to know nothing, while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.***

The follow is about 12 appeals on do not preach information apart from the true Gospel.</font>

### 1. Treasuring Christ above money
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that puts unnecessary obstacles in the way of People getting into heaven.

Jesus said: "How ddifficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God?". The answer is **Impossible**! It means **It can't be done**.

We can not make ourselves stop treasuring money above Chirst.</font>

### 2. Setting our affections on Christ
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that kindles suicidal desires in people.

The apostle Paul warned against the desire to be rich. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. And we all, both the poor and the rich constantly in danger of setting our affections , our hope, our security on riches rather than Christ.</font>

### 3. Be givers, not keepers
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that encourages vnlnerability to moth and rust.

Jesus tell us to be givers, not keepers.</font>

### 4. To have in order to give
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that makes good work a means of getting rich.

With our own hands to hard work. But the main purpose was not merely to hoard or even to have. The purpose was 'To have in order to give'. This is not a justification for being rich in order to give more. It is a call to ***make more and keep less*** so you can give more.</font>

### 5. Be content with what you have
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that promotes less faith in God's promise and diminishes the glory of God's help.

Our lord is our helper, and he will provide and protect. Be content with what you have. Because God promise he will never to leave us nor forsake us.
</font>

### 6. Be the good soil, be fruitful
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do no preach a gospel that contributes to people being choked to death.

It is like a seed that grows up among thorns. But as the seed grow, it will be choked by life worries, riches and pleasures, and it do not mature.</font>

### 7. Be light, be salt
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that takes the seasoning out of the salt and puts the light under a blasket.

The desire for wealth and the pursuit of wealth tastes and looks just like the world. Desiring to be rich makes us like the world, not different. In that case, we do not offer to the world anything different from what it already believes in. 

What you should be are the joyful willingness to suffer for Christ. What will make the world taste the salt and see the light of Christ in us is the willingness and the ability of Christians to love others through suffering.

***The saltiness is the taste of joy in the hardship.***</font>

### 8. The necessity of suffering
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that conceals the necessity of suffering in the Christian life.

***Through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom of God.***
The Peter too said that suffering is the normal pathway to God's eternal blessing.</font>

### 9. The importance of suffering in the Christian life
<font face="Menlo" size=4>Do not preach a gospel that obscures the God-ordained purpose of suffering in the Christian life.

Suffering is necessary for followers of Christ. But why?
</font>

> * Suffering deepens faith and holiness
> * Suffering makes your cup increase
> * Suffering is the price of making others bold
