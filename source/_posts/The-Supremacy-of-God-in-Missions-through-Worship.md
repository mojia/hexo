Missions is not the ultimate goal of the church, but worship is. When the age is over, and the countless mmillions of the redeemed fall on their faces before the throne of God, missions will be no more. It is a temporary necessity. But worship abids forever.

**Worship is the fuel and goal of missions.**
The goal of missions is the gladness of the peoples in the greatness of God. Worship is also the fuel of missions. Passion for God in worship precedes the offer of God in preaching. **You can't commend what you don't cherish**.

Where passion for God is weak, zeal for missions will be weak.
